#### **Quarter Life Crisis** | *DECO3500 - Social & Mobile Computing*

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Domain Challenge/Problem
The domain that Quarter Life Crisis (QLC) has chosen for the project is “Community”. In exploring how communities would improve the experience of a person through social and mobile technology, the QLC team noticed that there might be a gap in the market for a product that helps with consistency in goal achievement.

Goal Achievement theory is a broadly discussed topic when it comes to understanding the motivation somebody has when attempting to achieve a goal. Goal achievement theory is based on two types of goals: mastery and performance. While mastery looks at developing competence in a specific topic or area, performance relates to demonstrating to others that expertise has been reached (King and Watkins 2012).

The scope of the project that QLC wants to implement refers to this second type of goals, performance goals. While goal achievement theory tends to explore individual goal setting, there is interest in QLC to create a product that uses performance goal but in a group driven scenario. In a study with a women's college sporting team, it was found that group-focused individual goals were better at enhancing motivation, improving group cohesion, and goal achievement orientation than goals set by individuals themselves (Barbieri 2012). The study gave some evidence that when a group collaborates on setting goals for an individual, they are more likely to come up with more achievable results than if an individual sets goals without any help or feedback.

Apart from the study on group-focused individual goals, there is also interesting research on strengths-based group supervision. Strengths-based group supervision is a framework that is used in which the particular abilities and talents of a person are reinforced as a force to motivate them in different areas, that including goal achievement. In a study regarding psychiatric rehabilitation, early evidence showed that a strengths-based approach and group supervision could be particularly helpful in goal achievement (Rapp et al. 2014).

QLC wants to implement a concept that addresses the problem domain of goal achievement through the use of communities. The areas of concern that we will be addressing is the following: how can we use social technology and solutions in creating a community that can foster group-focused individual goal setting in combination with a strengths-based approach in order to create consistency in achieving performance goals.


### 1.2 Concept Scope
Following from the domain described before, the scope of the project is to create a system that facilitates the creation of virtual communities to aid individuals with motivation and goal achievement. The platform aims to address user dropout when it comes to consistency in the program or benchmark they have set.

Currently individuals wanting to develop and better themselves in aspects of their life are confronted with so many avenues or programs to aid in this development. From workout programs, to 30 day challenges, the amount of resources available is near endless.

However, retention rates and success rates vary a lot, and many users choose to drop out instead of pursuing their initial intent. While there may be several reasons for this dropout rate, we want to focus on the lack of supervision as well as setting unrealistic goals. The problem lies in the consistency and ultimately commitment to following through with a program, plan or goal that has been tailored for a particular person.

To target the lack of supervision and setting unrealistic goals, the system we will be creating will base itself on creating a community from a user’s existing pool of friends. These social community can provide both supervision, progress checking, and accountability while also being able to monitor whether or not a member of the community has set an unrealistic goal for themselves. The idea behind the scope is that those around a user can help them enforce task completion towards a goal, while also having better knowledge than strangers on what sort of goal is appropriate for an individual of the group.  

Various services have attempted to solve this problem of consistency/commitment through developing communities around their service or program. With the goal being to give users a reason to keep using the service, whether because of the competition, the moral support or other aspects. However, most of the users in one's community are not friends from real life, meaning there's very little accountability for users involved, and retention rates still consistently diminish.

## 2.0 Concept
### 2.1 Solution Outline / Rationale
The main premise for this project is creating a social platform for encouraging users accountability towards a task, plan or specific goal. The solution is to develop a platform where a user is able to invite a set of friends to validate and/or hold the individual accountable for completing a goal, with group defined rewards/consequences. Some of the functionalities available to the users as tools to maintain accountability and promote consistency will be messaging, system notices, overview reporting, and collective goal setting.  

Users can set a goal they would like to achieve such as going to the gym three times a week for a month, then they invite their close friends, specifying one or multiple people to validate a task is completed (eg. housemate, or photo/video evidence within the application). With a final consequence/reward set and voted upon by members of the group for the completion/failure of the task.

Members of the community have input on the goals set by each member before they are accepted. This will be implemented as a check for the group to maintain realistic and achievable goals as defined by members of each community. Once the goal is accepted, the system will allow for the goal to be set and support its completion by providing an accountability and consistency check.

As briefly mentioned before, the system will allow the submission of evidence such as photographs as well as individuals or group setting penalties if a goal is not achieved.

### 2.2 Project Aims
Increase user consistency/commitment towards goal achievement
Eventually decrease reliance on friends for accountability
Facilitate the creation of support systems within groups of friends
Allow for realistic goal setting through the use of collaborative interfaces.
Ease the tracking of goals through a progress checking platform
Create persuasive interfaces to increase motivation within user groups
