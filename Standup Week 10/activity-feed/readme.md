### Activity Feed Info
---

Activity feed is a *'card'* based social feed consisting of user activities. Although this prototype is at its *base* level, the concept of utilising a 'feed' to communicate a large variety of information to users is not new - eg. Facebook, Instagram, etc. The feed concept is especially useful when the information being display is not *always* of relevence to a particular user. As such, they can simply 'swipe through'. By utilising a feed for this prototype, users are able to skim through information that is irrelevent for them and quickly access information that **is** relevent for them.

#### More Accountability Background Information / Research
*Concepts to be infused into to final product*

**QUESTION FROM LAST SPRINT:** *What does it mean to be accountable?!*

Accountability is *delivering* on a commitment and having a responsibility to an outcome rather than just a responsibility of completing tasks.

###### What generally doesn't work...
Overly negative feedback given when people fall short of achieving is generally not productive for holding people accountable. If anything this practice (eg. getting angry) is a demotivator and reduces future performance (by instilling more pressure and fear of consequence, which further contributes to the problem).

###### What is better...
Fostering accountability requires clarity in five areas:
1. **Clear Expectations** - Clear about the outcome that is wanted. This is how success will generally be measured. Specificity gives a clearer path from A to B.
2. **Clear Capability** - What skills/resources does the person need to meet the expectations? Ideally, the person should have what is needed (or be able to acquire it) otherwise they are being *set up for failure*.
3. **Clear Measurement** - SMART. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic/Relevant, Time-bound. Mutual milestones/check ins and targets to meet. If targets slip, then they need to be addressed immediately to get back on track.
4. **Clear Feedback** - Honest, open and ongoing feedback. It's more important to be helpful than nice. Keep in relation to the context or measurement goals.
5. **Clear Consequences** - Repeat, Reward or 'Release' depending on the successfulness of the outcome.

**All 5 need to work together in the system. If even just one is missing, accountability will fall through that gap.**



###### Additional considerations:
6. **Commitment** - Invite commitment. Just because someone knows what to do doesn't mean they will do it. The understanding of how the task/context will benefit them personally (individual) as well as how their contribution will benefit the 'task setter' (group).
7. **Evaluation of Effectiveness** - Review the process. How can it be improved. Should the process change in the future??
8. **Consistency** - Habitual practice is an instinctively difficult thing to change. By monitoring the above 7 and 'checking on' them consistently the overall process can be pushed towards being habitual for the 'doer'. This will make it less of a 'big deal' and easier to achieve a desirable outcome.
    a. **Mindset** - self setting, education of the goal in context to bigger picture

Goals/task must be tied to the ambitions of a larger 'body', this gives context to multiple parties with different roles in achieving a successful outcome (eg. User & Group).

###### An Example
Example is scrum meeting. Eg. individual accountability occurs when the performance of each individual is assessed and results given back to the group in order to identify those in need of more assistance and support.

*Attributes of Groups More Likely to be success*
- Social skills
    - Know and trust each each other
    - Adjoin ambiguously
    - Accept and support each other
    - Conflict resolution

Johnsons (2009): Ones actions may:
- Promote the success of others
- obstruct the success of others
- have no affect on others

If working towards a common goal - each user is accountable to another's outcome as well as their own. e.g. The success of one individual helps other members to be successful(Gokhale, 1995).
In a group (CL) context, essential elements include:
1. Clearly perceived positive interdependence
2. considerable interaction
3. individual accountability
4. social skills
5. group self-evaluating

Many of these skills can be instilled into group members by simply assigning roles. Everyone then has a purpose. 
Members of the group teach what they've learned to someone else.

#### In our context:
- Limit to individual goals within a group common goal. 
**e.g. of Swimming Example:** Get better at Backstroke within the swimming common goal/tag. Using the group, the goal setter has a higher chance of using the crowd to assist specifically with that goal, as the group have knolwedge in the domain.
- *Key problems*:
1. Big group of unknown people with common goal - **TRUST**. This takes time to establish. In the context of achieving a goal, this is an unrealistic expectation (especially if short timeframes are involved). If this cannot be established and/or hesitation in initiating the establishment, then there is a less chance the person with the goal will be motivated to achieve a successful outcome when utilising the group, as they will be less willing to take advice and find it harder to relate to others in the group who may have achieved a similar goal. If they resort to an individual approach, then there is no point of the platform at all, as there is no supervision or consistency/commitment of community support.
2. Friends are uninterested in your goal and do not provide the necessary support and therefore the motivation resulting from is not present. The friendship group should be small to instill the 'trust' aspect only, otherwise a deviation from original goal may occur (eg. group may indirectly orient this direction because they are not *experts* in the particular area). Although, trust may not be an issue within a small friendship group, knowledge surrounding a particular goal in most instances will not be present. Further, this is dependent on location (eg. what if you moved from the snow to the beach & want to learn how to surf - none of your friends know how to surf because they have always lived in the snow!). If this small group cannot relate to the context themselves, then they will be less likely to contribute as much as they would if they had an active interest in the context, Thus reducing the motivational factor.

--

As such, the system would most likely benefit to include 2 'groups' who both actively contribute to a particular goal - a 'community' group (context experts) & trusted group (accountability experts). In addition, ideally a small friends group with a common goal would be more effective (whilst getting assistance/advice from the community) than an individual, as this is one of the problems surrounding trust (and context relation)

###### The System
- Propose a system where: you have your friends & the group both contributing to your outcome. Eg. Your friends may not be interested in you swimming whereas the swimming group/tag would.
- To enforce consistency and interaction - the friends group could 'vet' the larger group feedback. etc. This would benefit the overall achievement because you trust your friends.
- The feed is system primarily displays the social interaction between someone with a goal and friends, eg. commenting on the *'process'* from the 'expert' group. 
- Rewards: eg. Shop rewards - --> extra time for goal. Implementing rewards (even if they are fictional) gives another avenue for 'enticing' users to complete their goal.
