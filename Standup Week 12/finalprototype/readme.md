# Office Champions / Office Performers   - Workplace Accountability System

The evolved version of the concept was developed using the insights obtained through the investigation of the concept of accountability through the semester. This section outlines the idea behind *Pracc*, the problem space that it tries to address and how the application attempts attempts to provide an accountability solution for the target users.
