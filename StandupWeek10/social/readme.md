## The Concept

The concept was primarily reworked to enhance a social space as a network rather than communal groups. This causes emphasis to be placed on an individual social performance and used that as a motivator instead of relying on the accountability aspect of the initial concept. Sharing your own progress or a story subconsciously causes the user to evaluate their efforts and motivates them to perform and work towards their goals as it is open and documented.

## The Social Platform

Users can create a profile to follow and be followed. Users can create a goal, set a timeframe and intervals for their goals, add tags to their goals and complete and work towards continuous goals. Users can search and follow people and view their various goals and achievements. Similarly, users can search for specific types of goals, instead of individuals only.
