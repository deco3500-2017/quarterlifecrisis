## Enter the Gaming World

After presenting the first prototype in class, we were given harsh (but necessary feedback). In trying to create a full application, we lost sight of the exploration component of the project. Yes, we are aiming to design an application (or part of). However, we are attempting to design for a particular social and mobile computing problem and in our prototype very little of the testing session focused on learning more about accountability as an area of interest. Within the feedback we learned that, besides focusing too much on task progression, we also build a prototype that did went straight to the point instead of playing with design constructs like gamification. 

For this reason, the team decided that one of the prototypes should follow the path of gamifying accountability in goal completion. For this specific prototype, Sanjana and Sebastian would take initiative in developing the prototype and testing session to learn more about translating game elements into social and group accountability. 

## Throwing out the First Ideas

Before setting ideas in stone, a brainstorming session was carried out. The preliminary ideas helped pick some game elements that would be relevant to the context of goal completion. For example, and idea put forward was that of an update sequence every time the application is opened. This updated sequence would have a bar that displays ranges (danger zone, safe zone, excellence zone) in which a user could sit in withing their goals. If a user uploaded a photo to prove their are working on a goal, other users could give points to this task to move from a danger zone to the excellence zone. Everyday day a user does not participate on their goals their status would move closer to the danger zone. 

The point allocation system would be that of a circulating currency. As the members of the group allocate points, the recipient of those points could use those points gained to give them others based on their goal progression. This way, the total amount of points would always be the same but the amount that each player holds changes as the members vote on the progress of others. 

While the gamification elements were quite useful to explore from the beginning, we still lacked additional exploration on how users of our target market keep themselves accountable (outside and within a group). Leartning more about this would be the next step as this would give us a clearer idea on what elements need to be included in the application and the general theme of our system.
