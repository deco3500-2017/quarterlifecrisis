### What is the problem space and how did you address it?
The domain that Quarter Life Crisis (QLC) has chosen for the project is “Community”. In exploring how communities improve the experience of a person through social and mobile technology, the QLC team noticed that there might be a gap in the market for a product that helps with consistency in goal achievement.

QLC wanted to implement a concept that addressed the problem domain of goal achievement through the use of communities. The areas of concern that was addressed is the following: how can we use social technology and solutions in creating a community that can foster group-focused individual goal setting in combination with a strengths-based approach in order to create consistency in achieving performance goals.

The main premise for the project is creating a social platform for encouraging user’s accountability towards a task, plan or specific goal. The solution is to develop a platform where a user is able to invite a set of friends to validate and/or hold the individual accountable for completing a goal, with group defined rewards/consequences. Some of the functionalities available to the users as tools to maintain accountability and promote consistency will be messaging, system notices, overview reporting, and collective goal setting.

Users can set a goal they would like to achieve such as going to the gym three times a week for a month, then they invite their close friends, specifying one or multiple people to validate a task is completed (eg. housemate, or photo/video evidence within the application). With a final consequence/reward set and voted upon by members of the group for the completion/failure of the task.

Members of the community have input on the goals set by each member before they are accepted. This will be implemented as a check for the group to maintain realistic and achievable goals as defined by members of each community. Once the goal is accepted, the system will allow for the goal to be set and support its completion by providing an accountability and consistency check.


### How did you tackle this problem?
#### Stage 1
Initially, how concept centred around the completion of user created tasksm and the accountability (or lack off...) involved in the process to complete the task sucessfully. This iteration of the application, included a paper prototype of the user progession through the application from sign up to goal completion. Feeback receieved highlight improvements in paper protyping process and importance of testing 'vertically' (all the functionallity of **one** aspect) versus 'horizontally' (the entire product) - which we did.

#### Stage 2
- Gamification
- Screens from prototype

The team decided that one of the prototypes should follow the path of gamifying accountability in goal completion. 
The Carrot and the stick: The metaphor of the carrot and the stick is the idea that we will focus on with the next prototype. During the interviews, it was mentioned that in keeping someone accountable there is a need to understand if positive reinforcements or punishments works better for a particular person. The carrot and the stick comes in as a way of using both of these methods for each user. As users get closer to their goals, they would receive carrots as a reward and if they stalled progress then they could be given the stick as a punishment.

##### Social platform
 - Screens from prototype

This concept was primarily reworked to enhance a social space as a network rather than communal groups. This causes emphasis to be placed on an individual social performance and used that as a motivator instead of relying on the accountability aspect of the initial concept. Sharing your own progress or a story subconsciously causes the user to evaluate their efforts and motivates them to perform and work towards their goals as it is open and documented.


##### Newsfeed
- Screens from prototype

Propose a system where: you have your friends & the group both contributing to your outcome. For example, your friends may not be interested in you swimming whereas the swimming group would. This would help enforce consistency and interaction as the friends group could 'vet' the larger group feedback reliably as you trust your friends. The feed is system primarily displays the social interaction between someone with a goal and friends by commenting on the 'process' from the 'expert' group. This would go alongside the possibility of rewards or benefits within the application.

##### New final
- Screens from final prototype

The evolved version of the concept was developed using the insights obtained through the investigation of the concept of accountability through the semester. This outlines the idea behind our concept Pracc, the problem space that it tries to address and how the application attempts to provide an accountability solution for the target users. While the team did consider staying true to the original target market and the initial concept, many things changed and thus we wanted to introduce the prototype by first indicating the inspiration, then the concept idea, proceeded by the target user, and then ending with the specifications of the app and its potential.
