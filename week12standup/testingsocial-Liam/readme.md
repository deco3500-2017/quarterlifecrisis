### Testing
Record interactions and comments.
# Present user with each page.
Do you understand the content and functionality of the home page?

  Yes, it is like a newsfeed with recently completed goals from your friends.
  
Do you understand the content and functionality of the goals page?

  Yes, it is a list of your goals, like viewing your profile
  
Do you understand the content and functionality of the friend page?

	Yes, it shows your friends and their goals.

# Begin user on the home page for use testing.
Can you navigate to the goals page easily?
	Yes, it makes sense with the goals pinned at the top of the page.
	Comment(s): User used top navigation rather than lower global navigation bar.
Can you navigate back to the home page?
	Yes, home button is commonly used in many apps.
	Comment(s): Clicked instantly.
Can you navigate to the friend page?
	Yes, this is commonly used.
	Comment(s): Clicked promptly, due to nature of last task.
Can you navigate to the create goal page?
	Yes, would be better to have an easier way to start a goal.
Comment(s): User found create a goal through the goal page rather than the goal button in the lower global navigation bar.

# Test user knowledge and understanding of the app.
What do the numbered icons in the global bar indicate?
	The user’s current goals.
Do you understand the goal icons within the friend page?
	Yes, it is the type of goal they have, like cooking or swimming.
Does the multifunctionality of the pages allow for smoother navigation? (i.e. friends/search overlapping)
	I didn’t realise pages would be the same as each other at first but yes that is quite useful if there are multiple pages 	basically the same.
Is the concept behind goal creation comprehensive?
	I understand users would create goals with the criteria I saw in the premade goals but I don’t know how much freedom 		they will have in creating goals.
Would an expanded view be beneficial for goals? (Recap of each days recorded progress throughout the duration of the goal)
	Definitely, users want to see the journey someone has made not just the task for one day.

# Further Questions
Fundamentally, what makes you feel accountable for your actions and motivates you?
	I am quite goal driven so I do not often feel unmotivated. I often feel more accountable if I am working on team based 		tasks though because I don’t want to let them down.
Would having your goals and progress across social media motivate you to perform? Why/why not?
	Yes, I think that would help a lot of people. People already use social media to show off quite often so this would just 	give them another means to do that.
The positive and negative aspects of this approach are found through success being showcased and shortcomings being highlighted respectively. Do you think as a system this is a positive foundation to motivate users?
	I think in a system like this there will be both positives and negatives so it is hard to say one or the other. I think 	if people don’t complete goals they will feel bad and feel good if they do, so it goes hand in hand. It’s hard to say if	a majority of people will take it positively or negatively.
