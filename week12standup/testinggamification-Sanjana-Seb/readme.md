# Findings from Gaming Prototype Testing & Interview

The following are some insights on accountability and motivation that we found from some interviews we carried with users as they interacted with the prototype.

### Problems with the 3 option system

While we initially believed that a 3 tier solution (good, bad, and neutral) for pushing people worked, the tests revealed something interesting. there is concensus on the fact that recieving the carrot (positive reinforcement) helps people feel more motivated and accountable towards progressing more. However, there were conflicting responses on the nudges (warnings) and the stick (negative reinforcement).

When it came to the warning, a user mentioned that it is good to have this type of warning instead of going straight to a negative consequence. However it was noted that notifications can be easily ignored, and they could also be reinforcement to be accountable as much as a reminder of an incomplete goal.

In addition to this, there was also a negative connotation towards the person that gave the negative reinforcement given that a person might believe that they are closer to a goal when one of their peers is setting them backwards. This could lead to bad user experience and problems within the community of peers holding each other accountable. The users also did not feel that taking away points from someone was an effective way to get them to be more accountable and to be repeat users. Instead they suggested that if users do not progress on their goals, then they would just not recieve any points. 

### Specific themes

In both tests, the users mentioned that they understood the metaphor of the carrot and the stick. However, for such a general application (which could work with any goals) using a general metaphor may seemed detached. Therefore, they suggested that there be icons and comparisons that are closer for the task the users are being accountable in.

### Game Achievement and Momentum

One of the users mentioned that the idea of gaining experience, similar to a game scenario, was very entertaining to them. They also felt that this would give them momentum providing motivation to keep the progress up. It seems that the most important aspect of the gaming elements is the idea of winninng points and seeing the progress they have achieved. 

On the other hand, another user identified that for him this app would not work as he preferred to keep his goals private and that he believes in holding himself accountable for his shortcomings instead of putting the responsibility on others. Increasingly, it seems that there is more and more evidence on a two way split between those who would benefit from this app by helping others and those who would benefit from receiving help. There seems to be a lack of respondents claiming they would engage in both equally. 

## Changes to be actioned

From these findings, we will action the following changes to the concept:

* Instead of points that are given or taken away, the system will be based on ratings. This way, users can go down in their rating but it seems more recoverable. A loss of rating might not be seen as harsh as a loss in points. The original idea also had levels from which you could not drop, which put the users at a safety zone. With a rating, users are at a constant risk to dropping and so there is more motivation of being accountable. Using ratings will also solve the problem of setting benchmarks. 

* Once the team decides which scenario the system will target and what type of accountability will be integrated, then thwe appropriate content will have to be drafted to properly gamify the design.

* Gaming elements such as experience and earning points should be added onto the final application as it is shown that some users enjoy this motivator. However, this should not go into the domain of being to childish as there has to be a serious tone too in ensuring users take the accountability app seriosuly. 

* There will be a clear separation between sheriffs and goal achiveres. As we test more and more, there seems to be a split between those who believe such an app would work for them and those who accept that it would not work for them but they would use it to help others.
